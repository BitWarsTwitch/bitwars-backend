            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to PixelWars, a Twitch Extension designed to enhance your streaming experience through interactive animations. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to being transparent about what data we access, why we access it, and how we handle it. By using PixelWars, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
            <p>We collect minimal data to operate the PixelWars Extension. Here is a summary of what we access and why:</p>
            <p><strong>Twitch Username:</strong> We access your Twitch username after a successful purchase of bits within the Extension. This information is used solely to display your name within the on-screen animation.</p>
            <p><em>Note: This data is not stored or retained by PixelWars or any third-party server; it is accessed solely in real-time for immediate display within the Extension.</em></p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Backend Data Storage</h2>
            <p>Game States: PixelWars maintains game states on our backend to facilitate gameplay flow. This does not include any user-specific data or personal information.</p>
            <p>The backend data storage is limited strictly to the internal states necessary for the Extension to function as intended.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any user data with third parties. PixelWars is a standalone extension and does not transmit user information beyond the Twitch platform.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Security Measures</h2>
            <p>While PixelWars does not store personal information, we employ best practices to secure our backend infrastructure, ensuring that all gameplay data is processed safely and efficiently.</p>
